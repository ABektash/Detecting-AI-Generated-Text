# Detecting-AI-Generated-Text
 This project explores diverse methods to detect AI-generated text in both Arabic and English. We use machine learning models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, XGBoost, and Passive Aggressive with TF-IDF, alongside deep learning models like CNN, DNN, GRU, Bi-LSTM, and transformers ELECTRA and RoBERTa.
